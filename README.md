This repository contains a collection of one or more `tsdat` pipelines (as found under the ``pipelines`` folder) for 
ingesting and analyzing data collected by three versions of Sofar Spotter buoys (Spotter, Spotter2, Spotter3).
Pipelines relevant to each buoy are tagged with the corresponding version number. The basic workflow is to first run
the raw data through the initial ingest pipeline (`spotter_v1`,`spotter_v2`,`spotter_v3`), followed by the respective
VAP pipeline, which calculates wave parameters.

The `v2` pipeline series is the most robust of the three and will likely successfully run data from all Spotter
buoy versions. The latest `v3` pipeline will only work with Spotter3 zip files.

Zip folders that are too large can stall out an ingest pipeline; the `split_zip_folders.py` script located in this 
directory can break a large zip up into smaller zip folders.

## Repository Structure

The repository is made up of the following core pieces:

- **`runner.py`**: Main entry point for running a pipeline.

- **`pipelines/*`**: Collection of custom data pipelines using `tsdat`.

- **`pipelines/example_ingest`**: An out-of-the-box example `tsdat` pipeline.

- **`templates/*`**: Template(s) used to generate new pipelines.

- **`shared/*`**: Shared configuration files that may be used across multiple pipelines.

- **`utils/*`**: Utility scripts.

## Prerequisites

The following are required to develop a `tsdat` pipeline:

1. **A GitHub account.** [Click here to create an account if you don't have one already](https://github.com/)

2. **An Anaconda environment.**  We strongly recommend developing in an Anaconda Python environment to ensure
that there are no library dependency issues.  [Click here for more information on installing Anaconda on your computer](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html)

    > **Windows Users** - You can install Anaconda directly to your Windows box OR you can run via a linux
    environment using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).  See
    [this tutorial on WSL](https://tsdat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/setup_wsl.html) for
    how to set up a WSL environment and attach VS Code to it.

## Creating a repository from the pipeline-template

You can create a new repository based upon the `tsdat` pipeline-template repository in GitHub:

1. Click this '[Use this template](https://github.com/tsdat/pipeline-template/generate)' link and
follow the steps to copy the template repository into to your account.
    > **NOTE:** If you are looking to get an older version of the template, you will need to
    select the box next to 'Include all branches' and set the branch your are interested
    in as your new default branch.

2. On github click the 'Code' button to get a link to your code, then run

    ```shell
    git clone <the link you copied>
    ```

    from the terminal on your computer where you would like to work on the code.

## Setting up your Anaconda environment

1. Open a terminal shell from your computer
   - Linux or Mac: open a regular terminal
   - Windows: open an Anaconda prompt if you installed Anaconda directly
   to Windows, OR open a WSL terminal if you installed Anaconda via WSL.

2. Run the following commands to create and activate your conda environment:

    ```shell
    conda env create
    conda activate spotter
    ```

3. Verify your environment is set up correctly by running the tests for this repository:

    ```shell
    pytest
    ```

    If you get the following warning message when running the test:

    ```shell
    UserWarning: pyproj unable to set database path.
    ```

    Then run the following additional commands to permanently remove this warning message:

    ```shell
    conda remove --force pyproj
    pip install pyproj
    ```

    If everything is set up correctly then all the tests should pass.

## Opening your repository in VS Code

1. Open the cloned repository in VS Code. *(This repository contains default settings for
VS Code that will make it much easier to get started quickly.)*

2. Install the recommended extensions (there should be a pop-up in VS Code with recommendations).

    > **Windows Users**: In order to run python scripts in VSCode, follow steps A-C below:

    A. Install the extension Code Runner (authored by Jun Han).

    B. Press `F1`, type `Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)` and select it.

    C. Add the following lines to the list of user settings, and update `<path to anaconda>` for
    your machine:

    ```json
    {
        "terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.windows": "Command Prompt",
        "python.condaPath": "C:/<path to anaconda>/Anaconda3/python.exe",
        "python.terminal.activateEnvironment": true,
        "code-runner.executorMap": {
            "python": "C:/<path to anaconda>/Anaconda3/Scripts/activate.bat && $pythonPath $fullFileName"
        },
    }
    ```

3. Tell VS Code to use your new conda environment:
    - Press `F1` to bring up the command pane in VS Code
    - Type `Python: Select Interpreter` and select it.
    - Select the newly-created `tsdat-pipelines` conda environment from the drop-down list. You may need to refresh the list (cycle icon in the top right) to see it.
    - Bring up the command pane and type `Developer: Reload Window` to reload VS Code
    and ensure the settings changes propagate correctly.

4. Verify your VS Code environment is set up correctly by running the tests for this repository:
    - Press `F1` to bring up the command pane in VS Code
    - Type `Test: Run All Tests` and select it
    - A new window pane will show up on the left of VS Code showing test status
    - Verify that all tests have passed (Green check marks)

## Processing Data

- The `runner.py` script can be run from the command line to process input data files:

    ```shell
    python runner.py <ingest, vap> <path(s) to file(s) to process>
    ```

    > The pipeline(s) used to process the data will depend on the specific patterns declared
    by the `pipeline.yaml` files in each pipeline module in this repository.

- The `runner.py` script can optionally take a glob pattern in addition to a filepath. E.g.,
to process all 'csv' files in some input folder `data/to/process/` you would run:

    ```shell
    python runner.py ingest data/to/process/*.csv
    ```

- The `--help` option can be used to show additional usage information:

    ```shell
    python runner.py --help
    ```

### VAP Pipelines

- Value Added Product (VAP) Pipelines operate on the output of ingest pipelines. 

- The command to run these pipelines has a slightly different structure, where we enter the 
pipeline.yaml configuration file to use, as well as a start and end date:

    ```shell
    python runner.py vap <pipeline/<pipeline-name>/config/pipeline.yaml> --begin yyyymmdd.HHMMSS --end yyyymmdd.HHMMSS
    ```

- The --help option can also be used here if you get stuck:

    ```shell
    python runner.py vap --help
    ```
